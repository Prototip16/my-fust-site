    <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million.[1] 
        It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been
         a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium
          and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][10] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries
           hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century,[11] the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis
            around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, 
        and Hertfordshire,[12] which largely comprises Greater London,[13] governed by the Greater London Authority.</p>
